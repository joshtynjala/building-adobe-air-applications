# ADT help command

The ADT -help command displays a terse reminder of the command-line options:

    adt -help

The help output uses the following symbolic conventions:

- \<\> — items between angle brackets indicate information that you must
  provide.

- () — items within parentheses indicate options that are treated as a group in
  the help command output.

- ALL_CAPS — items spelled out in capital letters indicate a set of options that
  is described separately.

- \| — OR. For example, ( A \| B ), means item A or item B.

- ? — 0 or 1. A question mark following an item indicates that an item is
  optional and that only one instance can occur, if used.

- \* — 0 or more. An asterisk following an item indicates that an item is
  optional and that any number of instances can occur.

- \+ — 1 or more. A plus sign following an item indicates that an item is
  required and that multiple instances can occur.

- no symbol — If an item has no suffix symbol, then that item is required and
  only one instance can occur.
