# ADT sign command

The -sign command signs AIRI and ANE files.

The -sign command uses the following syntax:

    adt -sign AIR_SIGNING_OPTIONS input output

**AIR_SIGNING_OPTIONS** The AIR signing options identify the certificate used to
sign a package file. The signing options are fully described in
[ADT code signing options](WS5b3ccc516d4fbf351e63e3d118666ade46-7f72.html).

**input** The name of the AIRI or ANE file to sign.

**output** The name of the signed package to create.

If an ANE file is already signed, the old signature is discarded. (AIR files
cannot be resigned â€” to use a new signature for an application update, use the
`-migrate` command.)
