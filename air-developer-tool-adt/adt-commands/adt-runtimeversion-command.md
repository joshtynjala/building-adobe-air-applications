# ADT runtimeVersion command

<div>

The -runtimeVersion command reports the installed version of the AIR runtime on
a device or emulator. The command uses the following syntax:

    adt -runtimeVersion -platform platformName -platformsdk path_to_sdk -device deviceID

**-platform** The name of the platform of the device. Currently this command is
only supported on the Android platform. Use the name, _android_.

**-platformsdk** The path to the platform SDK for the target device. Currently,
the only supported platform SDK is Android. The AIR 2.6+ SDK includes the tools
from the Android SDK needed to implement the relevant ADT commands. Only set
this value to use a different version of the Android SDK. Also, the platform SDK
path does not need to be supplied on the command line if the
AIR_ANDROID_SDK_HOME environment variable is already set. (If both are set, then
the path provided on the command line is used.)

**-device** The serial number of the device. The device only needs to be
specified when more than one device or emulator is attached to your computer and
running. If the runtime is not installed or the specified device is not
connected, ADT returns exit code 14: Device error. If more than one device or
emulator is connected and a device is not specified, ADT returns exit code 2:
Usage error.

On Android, use the Android ADB tool to list the serial numbers of attached
devices and running emulators:

    adb devices
