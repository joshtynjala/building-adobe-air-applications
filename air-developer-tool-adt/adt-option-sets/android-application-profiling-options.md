# Android application profiling options

When the target of the package is apk-profile, the profiler options can be used
to specify which preloaded SWF file to use for performance and memory profiling.
The profiler options use the following syntax:

    -preloadSWFPath directory

**-preloadSWFPath** If present, the app will attempt to find the preload SWF at
the specified directory. If not specified, ADT includes the preload SWF file
from the AIR SDK.

**directory** The directory containing the profiler preload SWF file.
