# Signing an AIR intermediate file with ADT

<div>

To sign an AIR intermediate file with ADT, use the `-sign` command. The sign
command only works with AIR intermediate files (extension `airi`). An AIR file
cannot be signed a second time.

To create an AIR intermediate file, use the adt `-prepare`command. (See
[ADT prepare command](WS901d38e593cd1bac1e63e3d128fc240122-7fff.html).)

[ADT code signing options](WS5b3ccc516d4fbf351e63e3d118666ade46-7f72.html).

**airi_file** The path to the unsigned AIR intermediate file to be signed.
