# Adobe AIR updates

<div>

Periodically, Adobe updates Adobe AIR with new features or fixes to minor
problems. The Automatic Notification and Update feature allows Adobe to
automatically notify users when an updated version of Adobe AIR is available.

Updates to Adobe AIR ensure that Adobe AIR works properly and often contain
important changes to security. Adobe recommends that users update to the latest
version of Adobe AIR whenever a new version is available, especially when a
security update is mentioned.

By default, when an AIR application is launched, the runtime checks if an update
is available. It performs this check if it has been more than two weeks since
the last update check. If an update is available, AIR downloads the update in
the background.

Users can disable the auto-update capability by using the AIR SettingsManager
application. The AIR SettingsManager application is available for download at
<http://airdownload.adobe.com/air/applications/SettingsManager/SettingsManager.air>.

The normal installation process for Adobe AIR includes connecting to
http://airinstall.adobe.com to send basic information about the installation
environment such as operating system version and language. This information is
only transmitted once per installation and it allows Adobe to confirm that the
installation was successful. No personally identifiable information is collected
or transmitted.

#### Updating captive runtimes

If you distribute your application with a captive runtime bundle, the captive
runtime is not updated automatically. For the security of your users, you must
monitor the updates published by Adobe and update your application with the new
runtime version when a relevant security change is published.
