# AIR Debug Launcher (ADL)

Use the AIR Debug Launcher (ADL) to run both SWF-based and HTML-based
applications during development. Using ADL, you can run an application without
first packaging and installing it. By default, ADL uses a runtime included with
the SDK, which means you do not have to install the runtime separately to use
ADL.

ADL prints trace statements and run-time errors to the standard output, but does
not support breakpoints or other debugging features. You can use the Flash
Debugger (or an integrated development environment such as Flash Builder) for
complex debugging issues.

Note: If your `trace()` statements do not display on the console, ensure that
you have not specified `ErrorReportingEnable` or `TraceOutputFileEnable` in the
mm.cfg file. For more information on the platform-specific location of this
file, see
[Editing the mm.cfg file](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/flex/using/WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf69084-7fc9.html).

AIR supports debugging directly, so you do not need a debug version of the
runtime (as you would with Adobe® Flash® Player). To conduct command-line
debugging, you use the Flash Debugger and the AIR Debug Launcher (ADL).

The Flash Debugger is distributed in the Flex SDK directory. The native
versions, such as fdb.exe on Windows, are in the bin subdirectory. The Java
version is in the lib subdirectory. The AIR Debug Launcher, adl.exe, is in the
bin directory of your Flex SDK installation. (There is no separate Java
version).

Note: You cannot start an AIR application directly with fdb, because fdb
attempts to launch it with Flash Player. Instead, let the AIR application
connect to a running fdb session.

## ADL usage

To run an application with ADL, use the following pattern:

    adl application.xml

Where _application.xml_ is the application descriptor file for the application.

The full syntax for the ADL is:

    adl     [-runtime runtime-directory]
        [-pubid publisher-id]
        [-nodebug]
        [-atlogin]
        [-profile profileName]
        [-screensize value]
        [-extdir extension-directory]
        application.xml
        [root-directory]
        [-- arguments]

(Items in brackets, \[\], are optional.)

**-runtime _runtime-directory_** Specifies the directory containing the runtime
to use. If not specified, the runtime directory in the same SDK as the ADL
program is used. If you move ADL out of its SDK folder, specify the runtime
directory. On Windows and Linux, specify the directory containing the
`Adobe AIR`directory. On Mac OS X, specify the directory containing
`Adobe AIR.framework`.

**-pubid _publisher-id_** Assigns the specified value as the publisher ID of the
AIR application for this run. Specifying a temporary publisher ID allows you to
test features of an AIR application, such as communicating over a local
connection, that use the publisher ID to help uniquely identify an application.
As of AIR 1.5.3, you can also specify the publisher ID in the application
descriptor file (and should not use this parameter).

Note: As of AIR 1.5.3, a Publisher ID is no longer automatically computed and
assigned to an AIR application. You can specify a publisher ID when creating an
update to an existing AIR application, but new applications do not need and
should not specify a publisher ID.

**-nodebug** Turns off debugging support. If used, the application process
cannot connect to the Flash debugger and dialogs for unhandled exceptions are
suppressed. (However, trace statements still print to the console window.)
Turning off debugging allows your application to run a little faster and also
emulates the execution mode of an installed application more closely.

\-**atlogin** Simulates launching the application at login. This flag allows you
to test application logic that executes only when an application is set to
launch when the user logs in. When `-atlogin` is used, the `reason` property of
the InvokeEvent object dispatched to the application will be `login` instead of
`standard` (unless the application is already running).

**-profile _profileName_** ADL debugs the application using the specified
profile. The _`profileName`_ can be one of the following values:

- desktop

- extendedDesktop

- mobileDevice

If the application descriptor includes a `supportedProfiles` element, then the
profile you specify with `-profile` must be a member of the supported list. If
the `-profile` flag is not used, the first profile in the application descriptor
is used as the active profile. If the application descriptor does not include
the `supportedProfiles` element and you do not use the `-profile` flag, then the
_desktop_ profile is used.

For more information, see
[supportedProfiles](WSfffb011ac560372f2fea1812938a6e463-7fe2.html) and
[Device profiles](WS144092a96ffef7cc16ddeea2126bb46b82f-8000.html).

**-screensize _value_** The simulated screen size to use when running apps in
the mobileDevice profile on the desktop. Specify the screen size as a predefined
screen type, or as the pixel dimensions of the normal width and height for
portrait layout, plus the fullscreen width and height. To specify the value by
type, use one of the following predefined screen types:

| Screen type      | Normal width x height | Fullscreen width x height |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 480              | 720 x 480             | 720 x 480                 |
| 720              | 1280 x 720            | 1280 x 720                |
| 1080             | 1920 x 1080           | 1920 x 1080               |

| WVGA             | 480 x 800             | 480 x 800                 |

To specify the screen pixel dimensions directly, use the following format:

    widthXheight:fullscreenWidthXfullscreenHeight

Always specify the pixel dimensions for portrait layout, meaning specify the
width as a value smaller than the value for height. For example, the NexusOne
screen can be specified with:

    -screensize 480x762:480x800

**-extdir _extension-directory_** The directory in which the runtime should
search for native extensions. The directory contains a subdirectory for each
native extension that the application uses. Each of these subdirectories contain
the _unpackaged_ ANE file of an extension. For example:

    C:\extensionDirs\
        extension1.ane\
            META-INF\
                ANE\
                    Android-ARM\
                        library.swf
                        extension1.jar
                    extension.xml
                signatures.xml
            catalog.xml
            library.swf
            mimetype
        extension2.ane\
            META-INF\
                ANE\
                    Android-ARM\
                        library.swf
                        extension2.jar
                    extension.xml
                signatures.xml
            catalog.xml
            library.swf
            mimetype

When using the -extdir parameter, consider the following:

- The ADL command requires that each of the specified directories have the .ane
  filename extension. However, the part of the filename before the ".ane" suffix
  can be any valid filename. It does _not_ have to match the value of the
  `extensionID` element of the application descriptor file.

- You can specify the `-extdir` parameter more than once.

- The use of the `-extdir` parameter is different for the ADT tool and the ADL
  tool. In ADT, the parameter specifies a directory that contains ANE files.

- You can also use the environment variable `AIR_EXTENSION_PATH` to specify the
  extension directories. See
  [ADT environment variables](WS901d38e593cd1bac1e63e3d129cf8c19f1-8000.html).

**_application.xml_** The application descriptor file. See
[AIR application descriptor files](WS5b3ccc516d4fbf351e63e3d118666ade46-7ff1.html).
The application descriptor is the only parameter required by ADL and, in most
cases, the only parameter needed.

**_root-directory_**Specifies the root directory of the application to run. If
not specified, the directory containing the application descriptor file is used.

**-- _arguments_** Any character strings appearing after "--" are passed to the
application as command line arguments.

Note: When you launch an AIR application that is already running, a new instance
of that application is not started. Instead, an `invoke` event is dispatched to
the running instance.

## ADL Examples

Run an application in the current directory:

    adl myApp-app.xml

Run an application in a subdirectory of the current directory:

    adl source/myApp-app.xml release

Run an application and pass in two command-line arguments, "tick" and "tock":

    adl myApp-app.xml -- tick tock

Run an application using a specific runtime:

    adl -runtime /AIRSDK/runtime myApp-app.xml

Run an application without debugging support:

    adl -nodebug myApp-app.xml

Run an application in the mobile device profile and simulate the Nexus One
screen size:

    adl -profile mobileDevice -screensize NexusOne myMobileApp-app.xml

Run an application using Apache Ant to run the application (the paths shown in
the example are for Windows):

    <property name="SDK_HOME" value="C:/AIRSDK"/>
    <property name="ADL" value="${SDK_HOME}/bin/adl.exe"/>
    <property name="APP_ROOT" value="c:/dev/MyApp/bin-debug"/>
    <property name="APP_DESCRIPTOR" value="${APP_ROOT}/myApp-app.xml"/>

    <target name="test">
        <exec executable="${ADL}">
            <arg value="${APP_DESCRIPTOR}"/>
            <arg value="${APP_ROOT}"/>
        </exec>
    </target>

## ADL exit and error codes

The following table describes the exit codes printed by ADL:

| Exit code | Description                                                                                                                                   |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0         | Successful launch. ADL exits after the AIR application exits.                                                                                 |
| 1         | Successful invocation of an already running AIR application. ADL exits immediately.                                                           |
| 2         | Usage error. The arguments supplied to ADL are incorrect.                                                                                     |

| 4         | The runtime cannot be started. Often, this occurs because the version specified in the application does not match the version of the runtime. |
| 5         | An error of unknown cause occurred.                                                                                                           |
| 6         | The application descriptor file cannot be found.                                                                                              |
| 7         | The contents of the application descriptor are not valid. This error usually indicates that the XML is not well formed.                       |
| 8         | The main application content file (specified in the \<content\> element of the application descriptor file) cannot be found.                  |
| 9         | The main application content file is not a valid SWF or HTML file.                                                                            |
| 10        | The application doesn't support the profile specified with the -profile option.                                                               |
| 11        | The -screensize argument is not supported in the current profile.                                                                             |
