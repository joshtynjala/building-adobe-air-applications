# Packaging with ADT

<div>

The AIR SDK versions 2.6 and later support packaging for both iOS and Android.
Before packaging, all your ActionScript, MXML, and any extension code must be
compiled. You must also have a code signing certificate.

For a detailed reference on ADT commands and options see
[AIR Developer Tool (ADT)](WS5b3ccc516d4fbf351e63e3d118666ade46-7fd9.html).
