# Debugging a mobile AIR application

You can debug your mobile AIR app in several ways. The simplest way to uncover
application logic issues is to debug on your development computer using ADL or
the iOS Simulator. You can also install your application on a device and debug
remotely with the Flash debugger running on a desktop computer.
