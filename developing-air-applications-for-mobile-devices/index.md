# Developing AIR applications for mobile devices

<div>

AIR applications on mobile devices are deployed as native applications. They use
the application format of the device, not the AIR file format. Currently AIR
supports Android APK packages and iOS IPA packages. Once you have created the
release version of your application package, you can distribute your app through
the standard platform mechanism. For Android, this typically means the Android
Market; for iOS, the Apple App Store.

You can use the [AIR SDK](http://www.adobe.com/go/air) and Flash Professional,
Flash Builder, or another ActionScript development tool to build AIR apps for
mobile devices. HTML-based mobile AIR apps are not currently supported.

Note: The Research In Motion (RIM) BlackBerry Playbook provides its own SDK for
AIR development. For information on Playbook development, see
[RIM: BlackBerry Tablet OS Development](http://us.blackberry.com/developers/tablet/).

Note: This document describes how to develop iOS applications using the AIR 2.6
SDK or later. Applications created with AIR 2.6+ can be installed on iPhone 3Gs,
iPhone 4, and iPad devices running iOS 4, or later. To develop AIR applications
for earlier versions of iOS, you must use the AIR 2 Packager for iPhone as
described in
[Building iPhone apps](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/as3/iphone/index.html).
