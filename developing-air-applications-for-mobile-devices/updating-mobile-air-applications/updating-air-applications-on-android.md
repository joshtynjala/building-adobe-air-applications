# Updating AIR applications on Android

<div>

For apps distributed on the Android Market, you can update an app by placing a
new version on the Market, as long as the following are all true (these policies
are enforced by the Market, not by AIR):

- The APK package is signed by the same certificate.

- The AIR ID is the same.

- The `versionNumber` value in the application descriptor is larger. (You should
  also increment the `versionLabel` value, if used.)

Users who have downloaded your app from the Android Market are notified by their
device software that an update is available.
