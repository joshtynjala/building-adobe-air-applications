# Updating mobile AIR applications

Mobile AIR applications are distributed as native packages and therefore use the
standard update mechanisms of other applications on the platform. Typically,
this involves submission to the same market place or app store used to
distribute the original application.

Mobile AIR apps cannot use the AIR Updater class or framework.
